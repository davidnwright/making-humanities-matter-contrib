#####Maker or Assassin: The Charred Aura of the Re-made - Contribution to Making Humanities Matter - David N. Wright

In thinking about how fabrication might augment humanities scholarship, I often avoid confronting the following general question: if I am attempting to recreate or fabricate objects, what responsibility do I have to the politics of that object’s exchange? The question emerges forcefully when I account for my own motivations for fabricating. These motivations echo those articulated by Devon Elliott, Robert MacDougall, and William J. Turkel: “We fabricate objects related to our own historical interests, and then we play with them, modify them, share them with other people, and use them to ground conversations about the past and our relationship to it.”[1] While the exchange, examination, and manipulation of objects–historical or not–is an important mode of critical inquiry, there are important distinctions to be raised when these objects belong to an unaccounted for original context or are situated in contexts where playfulness and sharing might not be a welcome mode of cultural inquiry. 

For those of us without the requisite computer skills to design and render our own 3D dimensional objects in digital formats, the source files for desktop fabrication, particularly desktop 3D printing, are often accessed through online social communities such as [instructables](http://www.instructables.com/), [YouMagine](https://www.youmagine.com/), [Autodesk1123](http://www.123dapp.com/Search/content/all), and [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/) among many, many others. All of these sites feature some form of social file sharing, where digitized or digitally designed objects can be uploaded, and then be shared and discussed in an online community of like-minded "makers." Each of these websites--or digital file archives, to be more exact--facilitates the exchange and, to some extent, production of objects using a variety of desktop technologies. These websites are communities of exchange and of practice, where objects--in digital form--are exchanged and modified, processed or reprocessed.

While the online social milieu into which digitized objects drop would seem entirely democratic and might also seem to foreground innovative practices and corrections, it is not entirely without issue. What's lost in the somewhat ad-hoc nature of these online social communities for sharing digitized objects is the object's connection to context, be it historical, social, economic, or cultural. Unlike the material trinkets and tangible spare parts so often remediated into digital format and uploaded to these sites, most of the objects in this community of exchange are disconnected from any tangible context, rendered mostly as examples for what's technologically feasible. This absence of context is particularly true of objects that might be classified as having cultural value: geographical areas (topographic maps), architecture, people, museum artifacts--bowls, utensils, tools, fossils, and similar objects. While it would be dubious to make claims about what happens to cultural value when objects are exchanged inside an online community, it is clear that fabrication technologies, and the infrastructures that support them, invite interesting questions about our motivations for reproduction. 

Discussions about fabrication in the humanities ought to make an attempt to account for the shifting contexts that present themselves when objects are not "grounding" discussions, but rather uncoupling conversations from academic of intellectual rigour into the industrial paradigms of prototyping and manufacturing. As an example, consider the different intentions involved in "academic" approaches to fabrication and the more community-based models of an online community such as Thingiverse. Scholars such as Elliott, MacDougall, and Turkel advocate for "matter as a new medium for historical research" (122), building their own digital files and using fabrication to explore questions of interest to them which are, presumably, born out of long immersion in the discipline. Alternatively, an online resource such as Thingiverse is representative of how "the proliferation of digital sources--both the born-digital and the digitized--has created an economy of abundance" (122) where new questions might be asked, new objects discovered and revived. While both intentions have value, communities such as those represented by Thingiverse--communities that are not necessarily conscious of--or don't care about--academic methodologies for citation, dialogue, and recording--will play a role in determining what objects get reproduced.

In the emerging apparatus that supports desktop fabrication, source files are often corrupt, the software used to make those files sometimes dubious, and the desktop fabrication technologies themselves prone to misalignment, failure, or technical misreadings. As the still nascent activity of desktop fabrication—3D printing, laser cutters, and millers—finds legs, the practices and principles that guide fabrication are born out of a community of hobbyists or transient professionals. As a result, there is little in the way of quality control beyond the community of practice, which does not yet fully account for the potential signification that errors in fabrication might yield.

As a result of the above, the object fabricated through an online community of exchange carries with it a different kind of cultural synthesis, one that might arouse jealousy in current academic discourses about social knowledge and open resources. The object born from the infrastructures of desktop fabrication is at once part of the collaborative community at large, with individuals creating, adding to, and manipulating it—while at the same time represents a concerted and individual effort to analyze, choose, refine, and finally fabricate according to the set of desires inherent in the end user. Context then is set by the end user, not by the producer, nor by the object's origins. The found object of Thingiverse gets its context from how "makable" it is, not whether it helps to ground disciplinary conversations. The context for understanding the fabricated object is embedded in the process of its re-making, set by the communities that strip it of its original context(s); a context for understanding the object is not set by the historical, cultural, economic, or social narratives that govern the pre-fabricated or original context from which it was copied or created.

There is an opportunity here to advocate for these communities of exchange that harbour outside the confines of academic discourses and processes. Communities such as Thingiverse rarely linger over questions of historical reconstruction or cultural value, preferring instead to ground conversations about the object in discussions of the object's successful fabrication (or re-fabrication). Disentangling the process of fabrication from the errors, corruption, and failures inherent with new technological procedures often creates a sufficient "wow moment" to signal an endgame. The critical conversation moves toward issues of production rather than grounding or revealing historical narratives that might be set off by the reproduction of the object. Such transgressions of academic process are a rich source for new questions about--and readings for--objects that might be unduly connected to reverence and scarcity--the museum artifact, for example; or neglected by abundance--the trinket or conversation piece.  

Objects fabricated independent from any larger cultural or social questions, such as might be asked by the humanities scholar, are subject to infection by a fabrication infrastructure sometimes disconnected from any significations its context might offer. One gets a very clear sense of the issues raised by fabrication technologies when the objects to be reproduced become uncomfortable. Elliott, MacDougall, and Turkel use fabrication to ground disciplinary conversations because "there is an element of play to this kind of research. In fact, one of the main reasons that we do it is because it is fun."[^4]  In this instance, fabrication allows academic motivations to shift from grounding questions through academic rigour--itself a process--into grounding the search for such answers in "play." Play as a motivation is more at home in the open communities of Thingiverse and the other supportive appratuses of desktop fabrication than it is in academic discourse. 

Scale is one example of how online support communities for desktop fabrication disassociates objects from entrenched contextual markers. The actual scale of an object is often rendered moot by the restricted parameters inherent in the scale of the hardware and software required to produce the object. Scale then becomes one of the new contexts in which the object can be reconfigured and refabricated in a wildly inconsistent manner and without much thought as to the ramifications of manipulating that scale. 

Building on an acknowledgement of the effect error might have on the object’s cultural signification, material fabrication also needs to account for the permanence of the physical object that, once produced--even as an error or partial attempt—cannot accept changes or show the marginalia/evidence of its transformations--where little remains to mark cultural, economic, and aesthetic contexts.

Here I mean small pieces or parts that are not part of the general economic engine, they are discrete parts rather than over arching narratives. The same could be said for how trends in humanities fabrication have tended to reproduce archival objects, ephemera, or other "lost" objects rather than commonly available objects that might have less academic value. The social networks do however take this on, head on. 

Fabricating objects based on an incomplete sense of scale or reducing the scale of objects to make them manageable, sets off another sequence of socio-political signifiers such as those raised by the plasticity of their fabrication. In short, discarding the potential reductive effect of the object in favour of a defence that heralds its revival. Animating the very privilege that facilitates the fabrication, the object revives a host of emotional, cultural, social, political, even economic, narratives that signal the ontological approach rather than the scientific. 

Let's talk triggers here... object as anecdote. 

To begin with, the object is simply found, either through search, scrolling, or by algorithms that circulate the Thingiverse's object archive through the front pages of its site. 

In this pre-fabrication environment, the object is already going through transformations that could be construed as manipulating a context for understanding the fabricated object. The Altar is foregrounded in the on-screen interface in an urbanized environment that, though darkened, boxes or colonizes the object in a state that might, for instance, re-animates the process of colonialism. While no doubt designed to signal the technologically-savvy and largely urbanized community that created the file in the first place, the software interface places the indigenously-labelled object about to be fabricated within an urban, Westernized, capitalistic enclave, performing a colonial erasure and contextual reinvention, and allowing a community of unknown motivations to manipulate and process the cultural artifact.
The next step in the fabrication process involves the actual printing of the object using plastic filament; the object is at the mercy of the machine’s tendencies: At this point, one must ask what effect the fabricated object has on the cultural truths the Altar might signify. As Tim Sherratt has suggested, "The process of recall is unpredictable and sometimes disturbing--memories are often triggered involuntarily. Within a society memories are contested and contradictory."[^5] The materiality of once-erased spaces intercedes upon the intended outcomes, rendering any cultural critique or production inert. That is, while we may be able to fabricate erased objects--in this case using the Taiwanese Aboriginal Harvest Festival Altar as a representative example--we do not yet have a foundation for understanding and predicting triggers--be they cultural, social, economic--the reproduction of those models may elicit. We may be guilty, in our technologically-crazed zeal for reanimating erased spaces, of fabricating connections between materiality and memory, unduly activating difficult emotional reactions that are not accounted for in the value proposition for re-making erased spaces, which is about re- establishing erased truths and representing lost heritage.
The objects reproduced in these communities of exchange fabricate a myth of permanence, preservation, and success rather than the political, cultural, and social contexts the object might represent; locked in the process of making, and the drive to make it matter, once can avoid contextual issues because they do not exist in the communities of exchange, questions about the object, the maker, and the connections both have to cultural contexts of the past, present, and future remain unanswerable. While the object might represent a form of cultural knowledge--or dissemination--it does not account for--or represent--the expectations, biases, and failures of the communities that fabricate it.

We are forced into questions not only about the makers of the original object, but also our own motivations, our own shortcomings--technological, sociological, cultural, textual, pedagogical--in our approach to the original object; the trinket reveals much about its maker, owner, and the politics of its exchange. What the fabrication of objects made by online communities of exchange might show us is that these objects are not artifacts in a tactile or material sense, but rather are symbolic of a set of emotional, cultural, and economic realities that need to be read, examined, and critiqued. In other words, the fabrication of these objects--and the processes that fabrication represents--reveal much about our motivations. Looking at how objects make their way from these online communities of exchange into a state of materiality, open for discussion and critique, may allow us to discover how ontological narratives extend from our own experiences fabricating the object, enabling us to trace our own motivations for--and errors in thinking about--fabricating the object in the first place. 

When we move away from making and toward reproduction, it seems reasonable to suggest that working with desktop fabrication technologies to remake objects for contemplation is fabricating more than merely objects for scrutiny or playful exchange. The social dynamics and cultures springing up around desktop fabrication technologies seem to create new narratives embedded in the tactility of the objects they revive, reproduce, or oddly, erase even further—making stone into plastic.

In fact, removing the act of fabrication from academic discourse altogether is sure to yield more interesting discoveries than inserting it inside academic contexts. Fabrication in the humanities needs to use Thingiverse and the online communities that support desktop fabrication as a model for its own interrogative techniiques. Rather than overwhelm or "institutionalize" the methodologies associated with archival processes and so on, scholars need to look at how these communities of exchange ask different questions of their objects and look for different "hacks" that might produce the desired results. If our motivation is to play, then we cannot use fabrication as a way to "ground conversations" in academic discource. Otherwise, the well is poisoned. Academic discourse should use as its motivations the same context of play that informs the online exchange communities of Thingiverse and its kin.
