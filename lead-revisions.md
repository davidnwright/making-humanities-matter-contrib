Thinking about revisions to the MHM Piece:

- Ground it in New Old Things - outside the parameters of academic use
- Humanities is always trumpted as useful, how then to real-world hobbists, make?
- What's it like when we confront a new object in the wild and work to fabricate it
- Imagine the scenario where someone confronts the social network -- how is that network connected to the object... **how is the object erased by the network?** 
- The process does not begin with the design of the object, but with the machining of the object... lost is its cultural relevance... lost are the entaglements that lead to its production.
