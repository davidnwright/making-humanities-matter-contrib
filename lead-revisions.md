Thinking about revisions to the MHM Piece:

- Ground it in New Old Things - outside the parameters of academic use
- Humanities is always trumpted as useful, how then to real-world hobbists, make?
- What's it like when we confront a new object in the wild and work to fabricate it
- Imagine the scenario where someone confronts the social network -- how is that network connected to the object... **how is the object erased by the network?** 
- The process does not begin with the design of the object, but with the machining of the object... lost is its cultural relevance... lost are the entaglements that lead to its production.
- 9/11: if fabrication is ultimately an act of recovery, then what exactly is it recoverring? There is no ephemera, or is there? and what of that connection
- I need a quote about 9/11 that talks about what it represents in terms of the tangible loss of the space -- which is itself recovered by the 3D model...


**Comment on paragraph 3:**

How do playfulness and sharing pertain? It’s not obvious that they might; so I’d like to understand the turn to these two modes of engagement.

"I’m not sure what “erased” means here, and throughout the piece. Does it mean gone? Purposely destroyed and/or destroyed by time and erosion? Erased in a cultural/historical sense? Erased in scholarly rhetoric? Are these “spaces” physical spaces or representational spaces (eg. “filmic space”) and how do these spaces relate to “objects” also evoked in the paragraph. In this paragraph spaces and objects seem synonymous, but in most usage spaces are containers for objects. What is the “corpse”? Is it the erased thing? The revived erased thing? Odd to use it in the first sentence and not explain further."

I am finding this draft very provisional and hard to parse at a number of levels.  It needs a substantial rewrite. The only footnotes provided are to direct quotes, and there is no bibliography although the author brings in a whole variety of cultural theories plus a particular cultural artifact that is not contextualized in the prose. Terminology is imprecise and inconsistent and the thread of the argument wanders around a variety of issues. The author resorts to unsubstantiated truth claims on multiple occasions.

To start, the very provocative title doesn’t seem to be matched by the content of the piece. The word “aura” appears once, in the first sentence, and never again. “Charred” appears only in the title (with “context burning” once in paragraph 20). “Assassin” does not appear, nor do any synonyms for it, and there is no discussion of murder, killing, etc.—except that the word corpse appears as a metaphor in the first sentence in a puzzling way with no elaboration. 3D printed dead bodies show up later in a passing reference. Either the author intended a different paper than what’s provided here, or the title needs to be rethought to match the actual content.  With the title given, I would expect to know, soon into the paper, what a charred aura was, how it related to re-making, and especially why the author wants to accuse makers of being assassins.

The introduction of the paper also doesn’t seem to set up what the paper is about. As I understand it, the paper wants to consider the ethical questions around the sharing of 3D models and the 3D prints that result from them, apparently with a focus on Thingiverse. (The Thingiverse context is not stated here overtly, but is in a shorter version of this discussion on the author’s website.) More specifically, the author seems to want to focus on several aspects of the printing of these shared 3D models related to reconstruction of now-lost cultural artifacts or built environments, primarily the “colonialism” of such appropriations and the “cultural truths” that are lost in the process.  In the opening paragraphs, and throughout the piece there are, in addition, a series of more general statements made about the nature of objects, of representation, of materiality, of communities of practice, that seem to be intended to shed light on the more central focus, but at present they don’t especially do that. They are unsupported either by footnotes referencing more complete discussions by others, or by supporting evidence provided by the author. The disparate generalizations and characterizations seem to send the prose off in many different directions. Therefore, the author needs to write an introduction to the paper that focuses its content and that actually introduces the project at hand. 

Please, instead, write an introduction that sets the reader up for the content you plan to focus on, which seems to be the issues I just characterized, in conjunction with the example of the “Taiwanese Aboriginal Harvest Festival Altar” model at Thingiverse, and a plastic print of the same.
I don’t feel that the subheadings are useful in this paper as currently presented. Because the wording of the subheadings only tangentially relates to the content of the sections it’s hard to see why they’re needed.

Here are some questions and observations:

What is an “erased space” and/or “erased object” in this piece? It seems to mean several things: a piece of the human built environment that is no longer extant, or no longer extant in its “original” setting, but also it seems to mean an objectified physical representation/model of that “original” thing. A “loosely defined” list of examples is provided in paragraph 8. I’m not comfortable with this term being “loosely defined” by examples only (e.g. I know it when I see it), when the idea of erased space/object seems to be at the intended heart of analysis.

“Fabrication” is a difficult word to use in the way it is throughout the piece. Most cultural artifacts made by humans are “fabricated” and without some sort of explanation, the word can’t be used to contrast all human artifacts to those made with “desktop fabrication” technologies.  The author needs to find a consistent term or phrase that refers to the specific kind of making of 3D prints (or laser cuts or CNC milled parts, or whatever the boundaries of his specific breed of fabrication are) and define it once and then use the term or phrase consistently.

I also need to reiterate that the way the Taiwanese Aboriginal Harvest Festival Alter is currently used in the piece, which seems to be making a strong argument against appropriating representations of cultural artifacts–assuming colonizing is a bad thing, these days–is almost bizarre. It reads as if the author has no idea what the thing is, either the original that it represents, or the model that was uploaded by a particular Thingiverse user on a specific date. On the other hand, the example seems to offer interesting potential for the discussion of 3D printed reconstructions of built environments. BUT, the author needs to state his subject position. He needs to either tell his reader something about the original context of the Altar as well as about its erasure as well as the known intentions of the person who modeled it, or instead explicitly acknowledge that he knows nothing about any of that, and is taking it at face value from its presentation on Thingiverse. If the Altar is being taken at face value from its presentation on Thingiverse, then there’s still quite a bit of interesting analysis to be had, but don’t keep alluding to erasures and exploitations and cultural truths when all you have are your own assumptions. (I have excluded from consideration the possibility that the author intends to “colonize” the Altar as an example of what can happen.)

I realize this may all may sound harsh. There is surely a kernel of an interesting paper in here, and I look forward to seeing it emerge. That will only happen with some focused thought, careful attention to language, a studied attention to argument and evidence, and the very judicious use of generalizations.

"The opening paragraph presents an interesting and, I think, important thread of thought to be taken up; however, the second paragraph of the introduction left me unprepared for the essay that follows. Perhaps you could introduce a clearer methodology here? Or expand on what you mean by 3D printing as “encouraging unforeseen fractures in (and connections to) the exchange and significance of cultural artifacts”? I look forward to reading the final draft of this piece. Thank you for sharing your work."


**Comment on paragraph 8:**

“Artifactual objects” is an unfortunate usage here. I assume it means something introduced in process, possibly in error, but “artifact” has a much more common and straighforward meaning in relation to physical objects: a material product of human culture. Thus, for most readers in most context, “artifactual object” simply equals “artifact” equals primary cultural evidence.

So are you advocating for a politics of (re)fabrication? Is it fabrication or re-fabrication?

How does one fabricate a space? I realize that one might fabricate objects and features of a place that might produce a sense of space. Is this what you are suggesting?

Why “corpse”?

**Comment on Paragraph 10:**

Real vs. unreal doesn’t work here: a dyed plastic thing made w/ a 3D printer is just as “real” as its wood or stone counterpart carved by hand. There are other distinctions between them, but not their realness. Likewise, with the example of the book, literary scholars too often do just the opposite of what you suggest and talk about books without taking the physical book into account at all. There is a whole “history of the book” and “material culture of the book” trend within literary studies to counter this. Plus, I bet a lot of authors engaged quite directly and excitedly with the physical instantiations of their books.

**Comment on paragraph 13:**

I would benefit from discussion of an explicit example.

**Comment on Paragraph 14:**

Gratuitous references to Auschwitz are generally a bad idea. More importantly, as scholars should we give in to the idea that we can only ask “difficult and important” questions about content that directly evokes death or genocide? I guess it depends who the “we” is here but I can imagine people who would find it “fun” to 3D print (items standing in for) “dead bodies” in specific circumstances. On a theoretical level, how do the issues you raise touch on “materiality” in particular? Narratives of Auschwitz or dead bodies, for example, would be as affectively “difficult” as 3D prints (or other types of representations) of them.

**Comment on Paragraph 18:**

 "I might suggest beginning the short essay with a thick description of the object and the process of its fabrication in order to point to the stakes/politics of 3D printing. Moreover, it would ground the discussion in a concrete example, which would serve to clarify, for example, the notion of an erased space."

**Comment on paragraph 23:**

I’m still not convinced that the term is “erased spaces.” “Space” is very different from “place.” And you seem to be referring to historical sites whose structures and related objects have been displaced/removed/demolished/transformed. I do think the question of responsibility or ethics in reconstituting historical sites is relevant, nay, necessary. And with this the question of how such reconstitution happens–be it by means of AR overlays on mobile screen interfaces, reconstructions or ghost structures, or 3D fabrication.

**Comment on paragraph 26:**

These intriguing questions are particularly difficult in the context of this article because the author has given us no “cultural truths”, by which I mean, contextual information, about his example of the Taiwanese Aboriginal Harvest Festival Altar or the nebulous users of the Thingiverse model who might chose to 3D print it. He has forcefully failed to show how his inquiry might yield “truths” about Taiwan’s annual harvest festival or the use of altars or aboriginal people in Taiwan (as opposed to… Chinese, presumably?) or their beliefs or their architectural construction techniques or… and yet the “trinket” is supposed to reveal something fixed and inherent? In the absence of any reference to appropriate cultural description or analysis, we’re left with a philosophical argument that “truth” is somehow embedded in physical objects. That’s pretty much contrary to the last fifty years of humanities scholarship and deserves, at the least, some footnotes to the critical-philosophical scholarship that grounds such grandiose claims. If that is the author’s belief, then perhaps it should ground the whole article rather than appear for the first time in the conclusion.




**General Comments:**

* Generally speaking, I read this draft as a direct response to Elliott et al.'s work. Would it help to make that engagement more explicit? For instance, I get the impression that "we" (including its use in the first paragraph) frequently means "Elliott et al." What if the chapter were revised to be more of a dialogue with "New Old Things"? Would such a gesture help you ground the 2500 words?
* From my perspective, the chapter may need to explain why fabrication is historically unique. Otherwise, perhaps fabrication is given too much credit or weight?
* At times, the structure of the writing is somewhat repetitive (e.g., "When we VERB"). 
* While reading, I found the paragraph starting with "The 3D printed object..." quite vague. 
* I'd cut the gratuitous reference to Auschwitz.
* When describing the printing process, you suggest that "The process begins by loading..." But doesn't the process begin with creating the model or digitizing an object? Or are you purposefully privileging the consumer / end-user position?
* I also think the altar needs A LOT more context. Perhaps the entire chapter could be anchored in a particular object? I know that's a substantial revision, tho.
* While reading, I got the feeling that, ultimately, any technology could do this: "fabricating connections between materiality and memory." Know what I mean? Again, what makes digital fabrication unique?
* I frequently felt as if the references to "truth" were rather lofty and unsubstantiated.
* All that said, I found the emphasis on the ethics of reanimating ghosts, or of triggering traumatic events, compelling. I'd be interested in hearing more about how 3D models + fabrications reanimate and trigger differently than other media, and how the performative or experiential character of the past is entangled with situation (or the present).
