The title harkens back to Walter Benjamin's aura--wherein the work of art loses its resonance amidst remediation and mecahnical reproduction. Benjamin's thoughts about reproducability are particularly resanant as we continue along the path of fabrication technologies that reproduce just about anything at this point. Benjamin suggests that the work of art loses it aura--an aura usually created by its scarcity--as images or copies of it are remediated in film, or other media. 

I need to use the aura to frame 3D printing as a mode of fabrication that plays with or problematizes the associations that a trinket might possess. It destabilizes the references an object might have for an individual... where trinkets are usually marked by the stories that accompany them--a reproduction of a desired object, an aunt's visit, a souvenir--the objects printed off from Thingiverse are disconnected from these narratives of memory. There connection to the actual object tangential to the success of actually making the object. The narrative surrounding the trinket is not a story or personal narrative. Rather, it represents a successful fabrication.

The slippage in the term fabrication is interesting to me here because the stories can then be invented. Or they might not exist at all. The problem this creates is one where the object is completely disconnected from its associated narratives of place, individual, or even culture (that last one is a tough one). The object represents a different history--one that runs parallel to--the

Do a search on "tricnket" and "911" and then move on... maybe one more on trinket. 

The first rule of the other essay is that the Taiwainese's lack of context is precisely the point. There's no context in which to understand it, and that's the problem.  

  

The reference to Benajmin's aura Not meant to invoke a conversation about Benjamin and the resonance of is theories or a conversation about reproducabililty and its effect on art--ground well covered. Instead, I want to focus the docussion on the universe of Thingverse and the free exchange of objects and one particular example of the World Trade Center. In so doing, I hope to argue that the aura of even the tricnket, not just the work of art is losing some resonance and may be acting as a trigger for further issues such as...
