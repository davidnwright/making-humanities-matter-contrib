## Notes on the Jentery Essay

*"A trauma trigger is an experience that causes someone to recall a previous traumatic memory, although the trigger itself need not be frightening or traumatic and can be indirectly or superficially reminiscent an earlier traumatic incident.[1] Trauma triggers are related to posttraumatic stress disorder, a condition in which sufferers often cannot control the recurrence of emotional or physical symptoms,[1] or of repressed memory.[2][3][4] Triggers can be subtle and difficult to anticipate,[5][1] and can sometimes exacerbate PTSD. A trauma trigger may also be referred to as a trauma stimulus or a trauma stressor.[6]*

The "superficially reminiscent" bit is interesting. Wondering about how that could implicate the 3d replication or fabrication of both spaces and individuals. The key question:

what's the difference between reproducing the object as an image and fabricating it on a Makerbot?
- well, the most obvious is the 3 dimensions, giving the object a materiality the image does not possesses. While the 3d fabricated object is still a representation, it is one that deploys itself in 3 dimensions, bringing that representation into relief against other objects or artifacts that themselves may or may not be fabrications. 
- the tactile nature of the replication necessarily reproduces the lines of the original maker, not the copyist. Where any object can be replicated, the replication contains traces of the copyist, not the software, machine ware of the 3d printer. The machines are capable of reproducing not only their traces, but the traces of the original producer.
- The loss of the copyist as 'behind the camera'. There is no assumed observer in the 3d printed object because that object enters the material record outside the confines of its own representation. It can be framed, but it can also simply enter and replace the object.

For all these reasons the 3d printed object harbours additional trigger elements than other forms of representation. Different ones. 

And what of this materiality? The objects ability to be manipulated by others, touched, moved, places, exchanged. All of these factors need to be addressed when considering the recorded traces of the object.

Reproducing the New Westminster Chinatown for instance allows for the miniaturized model to placed within the boundaries of the actual, or real, traces of new west Chinatown. We can either replicate full scale, or we can replicate miniature, but the implication is the same. One can easily imagine the disturbance caused by a full scale replication of Dachau or ither concentration camps. In order to better understand these spades,  models are reproduced and rendered as cultural history. 

What are the implications of this kind of replication when it appears outside the context of the original? 
- new spaces recontextualizes the original as well.... It is both accessible and inaccessible at the same time. It holds the spaces of the original 
- Who is doing the making? Thinking about the public sharing if files here... You can do the Makerbot but from the SNC INKE but here. In other words, the Taiwanese house is an examples of how these fabricated models can now be housed outside traditional contexts of museums, libraries, or other contexts of authority. 
- So what' style difference between this and a tamia model? The tamia model is reproduced to sell.... Not necessarily share. It still belongs to the cultural laws of supply and demand. Not hobbies.
