#####Anyone Can Cook: The Charred Aura of the Re-made - Contribution to Making Humanities Matter - David N. Wright, Douglas College

----

When we talk about about fabrication in the humanities, we often avoid confronting the following general question: if we are attempting to revive erased cultural spaces by re-fabricating them, what responsibility do we have to the corpse’s social, political, economic, and cultural aura? The question emerges forcefully when we account for motivations such as those suggested by Devon Elliott, Robert MacDougall, and William J. Turkel: "We fabricate objects related to our own historical interests, and then we play with them, modify them, share them with other people, and use them to ground conversations about the past and our relationship to it."[^1] While the exchange, examination, and manipulation of objects--historical or not--is an important mode of critical cultural inquiry, there are important distinctions to be raised when these objects belong to an unaccounted for original cultural context or are situated in contexts where playfulness and sharing might not be a welcome mode of cultural inquiry. Put another way, how should we consider, integrate, or confront emotional effects produced by the revival of the previously erased or inert? Focusing on 3D printing and its inter-related communities of production, I want to look at how the production of material objects by 3D printing mediates the transaction of cultural artifacts and offers insights into cultural critique. Suffice to say, there is a considerable space for understanding the current rush to fabricate as encouraging unforeseen fractures in (and connections to) the exchange and signification of cultural artifacts.

###The Filament

Where there is no doubt common agreement that "Representations always undermine the things represented, and any attempt to make things more concrete invariably leads to unexpected difficulties"[^2] we must also account for how fabricated representations, to borrow a phrase from John Durham Peters, "mark human meaning and intention."[^3] In cases of humanities fabrication, it's imperative, as best we can, to account in some way for both meaning and intention. As such, looking at how the re-fabrication of lost cultural objects using 3D printing technologies allows us to discover things about the original object itself and trace our own motivations--and errors--for re-fabricating the object in the first place. 

When we fabricate objects using 3D printing technologies as they currently stand, the reproduction of erased spaces—loosely defined as demolished buildings, destroyed geographic features, lost/stolen objects, artifactual objects—is infiltrated upon by the plasticity of their fabrication. By re-producing erased objects using materials sometimes not even present in the original contexts, our re-fabrication creates a distorted sense of materiality. Even when the materials are the same—the reproduction in the same material as the erased original—the reaction to the fabricated materiality suggests a fracture or obtuse connection to the original, erased, object; we often do not account for the fabrication of materiality. The filament that joins the 3D printed object to its community—both as cultural owners and as fabricators—is broken by consistent failures, errors or flaws in processing, and the rigidity of fabrication material choices.

The 3D printed object is a text in that it can be read, catalogued, stored and transmitted in a variety of formats from physical to electronic; it can be read in different contexts, manipulated, moved in space and catalogued according to rubrics. Like the traditional mediated text, the object captures and communicates ideas across space and time. However, one of the current fictions of a 3D printed object is that its materiality signifies the success of the end product. That is to say that rather than reveal cultural meaning, the object's successful fabrication (or re-fabrication) often produces a sufficient "wow moment" leading the conversation toward issues of production rather than the mysteries of the object itself; successful fabrication is the end game. The fabricated object carries with it a different kind of cultural synthesis. It is at once “real”—tangible, spatial, manipulatable—and “unreal”—fabricated, plastic, dyed. The object tends to signify the success of the fabrication itself, rather than the representation or symbolic effect of its re-making or its reintroduction into cultural exchange. It’s as if the author were to suddenly declare, holding up something that looks like a historical novel: “Look, I made this book!” without ever addressing the content, its possible significance or its role as a potential cultural artifact. As I'll discuss in a moment, rendering erased spaces in plastic sometimes infects them with a fabrication infrastructure sometimes disconnected from any significations its cultural capital might offer. Often amazed by the process of fabrication itself, we tend to avoid asking where the fabrication materials are coming from and how they might signify precisely the disenfranchised group that was once in possession of the original object.

Taking this filament linking the completed object to the politics of its revival into account then, it seems reasonable to suggest that working with 3D printers to revive erased spaces for cultural critique is fabricating more than merely objects for scrutiny. What 3D printing does is fabricate new cultural cross-references embedded in the tactility of the object it revives, reproduces, or oddly, erases even further—making stone into plastic.

###The Tyranny and Enlightenment of Error

One gets a very clear sense of the issues raised by fabrication technologies such as 3D printers when the objects to be reproduced become uncomfortable. For instance, reproducing erased spaces or objects is pretty great when "there is an element of play to this kind of research. In fact, one of the main reasons that we do it is because it is fun."[^4] However, if we begin reproducing dead bodies in plastic or the horrific ovens of Auschwitz in plastic, is it still "fun"? In this instance, the fabrication forces scrutiny as to our motivations for fabrication and invites difficult and important questions about the role of materiality in humanities-based inquiry and discourse. 
 
Enthused as we are with the potentialities of the emerging fabrication technology, we rush to “see if it’ll print” or “scale it to fit” the machinery to which we have access. For example, when we fabricate objects based on an incomplete sense of scale or reduce the scale of erased spaces to make them manageable, we necessarily set off another sequence of socio-political signifiers such as those raised by the plasticity of their fabrication. In short, we discard the potential reductive effect of the erased space’s very absence in favour of a defence that heralds its revival. Animating the very privilege that facilitates the fabrication itself, the reproduced object revives a host of emotional, cultural, social, political, even economic, signifiers that signal the domain of humanities scholarship. When we fabricate using 3D printing technologies, it’s very hard to avoid rendering erased cultural spaces, the cultural production associated with those spaces, and the emotional reaction they might illicit, as trinkets. That said, these trinkets invite interesting questions about motivation--or as Peters might suggest--the "marks of human meaning and intention."  

Largely determined outside the parameters of the 3D printer itself, scale and materiality are rendered moot by the tyranny of error brought on by the use of the hardware and software required to produce the object. Source files are corrupt, the software used to make those files sometimes dubious, and the printing machines themselves are prone to misalignment, failure, or technical misreadings. As the still nascent activity of desktop 3D printing—along with other forms of desktop fabrication such as laser cutters and millers for that matter—finds legs, the practices and principles that guide fabrication are born out of a community of hobbyists or transient professionals. As a result, there is little in the way of quality control beyond the community of practice, which does not yet fully account for the potential signification that errors in fabrication might yield.

Building on an acknowledgement of the effect error might have on the object’s cultural signification, material fabrication also needs to account for the permanence of the physical object that, once produced—even as an error or partial attempt—cannot accept changes or show the marginalia/evidence of its transformations. This is particularly important given that most reconstitutions of erased spaces tend to look for sources in the margins of society—those neglected, historical, erased, highly isolated, prototypes (or silences)—where little remains to mark cultural, economic, and aesthetic contexts.
The object in the photo below, printed using the Makerbot infrastructure—on-line community (Thingiverse), software, and 3D printing machine—illustrates some of the potential issues raised by a community of practice focused on the dissemination of the source file and success of the object’s rendering rather than the object’s cultural resonance. The process begins by loading the community-made .stl file of the Taiwanese Aboriginal Harvest Festival Altar[^5] into the Makerbot preparation software.

In this pre-fabrication environment, the Altar is already going through transformations that could be construed as manipulating its cultural place. The Altar is foregrounded in the on-screen interface in an urbanized environment that, though darkened, boxes or colonizes the object in a state that re-animates the process of cultural erasure. While no doubt designed to signal the community that created the file in the first place, the software interface places the indigenous object about to be fabricated within an urban, Westernized, capitalistic enclave, performing colonial erasure and context burning yet again, allowing a community of unknown motivations to manipulate and process the cultural artifact.
The next step in the fabrication process involves the actual printing of the object using plastic filament; the object is at the mercy of the machine’s tendencies.

At this point, one must ask what effect the fabricated object has on the cultural truths the Altar might signify. As Tim Sherrat has suggested, "The process of recall is unpredictable and sometimes disturbing – memories are often triggered involuntarily. Within a society memories are contested and contradictory."[^5] The materiality of once-erased spaces intercedes upon the intended outcomes, rendering any cultural critique or production inert. That is, while we may be able to fabricate erased objects—in this case using the Taiwanese Aboriginal Harvest Festival Altar as a representative example—we do not yet have a foundation for understanding and predicting triggers—be they cultural, social, economic—the reproduction of those models may elicit. We may be guilty, in our technologically-crazed zeal for reanimating erased spaces, of fabricating connections between materiality and memory, unduly activating difficult emotional reactions that are not accounted for in the value proposition for re-making erased spaces, which is about re- establishing erased truths and representing lost heritage.
With its flat colour, trailing spindles, lopsided planks, and buttered edges, the 3D printed Altar above shows the many layers of its fabrication that cannot be peeled back. The errors visible, the object becomes a bastardized fabrication of the original, forever rendered in plastic. The fabrication has not melted seamlessly, blending the layers into one another, creating the perception of smoothness, refinement, and completion. Instead, the hardware—and the process that governs its use—scans, renders, and finally fabricates erased spaces, representing a re-colonization rather than a renewed existence—one that is set off by the errors inherent in the object final state. The ugly fabricated Altar makes the cultural truths the object is trying to preserve subject to perversion, forcing us to ask: “What kind of reproduction is this? What are we fabricating: exploitation, destruction, displacement?”

The objects we reproduce fabricate the myth of permanence, preservation, and success rather than the political, cultural, and social values the object might represent; we can fabricate as many Taiwanese Aboriginal Harvest Festival Altars as we want, but each rendering, each story locked in the imperfect lines of plastic filament, will raise different questions about the object, the maker, and the connections both have to cultural contexts of the past, present, and future. The very act of reproduction opens many questions from those groups who might claim ownership over the fabricated object itself. This includes the group who might “own” the original artifact, but also extends to the community that creates the source files, the community that builds upon it, revises it, and makes still more copies of it. The artifact represents a form of cultural knowledge—or dissemination—and as such carries with it the expectations, biases, and failures of the communities that fabricate it.

Traditionally, such results are taken in a negative light. However, there is much to be gained from having the cultural truths the object carries with it into our world revealed so evidently. In short, the tyranny of error reveals another set of questions or avenues for interrogating the original object. The fabrication, like most lies, reveals more truth than we might otherwise give credence. We are forced into questions not only about the makers of the original object, but also our own motivations, our own shortcomings--technological, sociological, cultural, textual, pedagogical--in our approach to the original object; the trinket reveals much about its maker, owner, and the politics of its exchange. What the fabrication of erased spaces might show us is that these spaces are not artifacts in a tactile or material sense, but rather are symbolic of a set of emotional, cultural, and economic realities that need to be read, examined, and critiqued thoughtfully so that we are equipped to process the enlightenment they might provide about our cultural moment past and present. Fabrication then invites us to account for the “fixed” truths fabricated by the 3D printing machine.
