Fabricating Erased Spaces: The Charred Ephemera of the Re-made


When we talk about fabrication in the humanities, we often avoid confronting the following general question: if we are attempting to recreate or fabricate objects, what responsibility do we have to the politics of that object’s exchange? The question emerges forcefully when we account for motivations such as those suggested by Devon Elliott, Robert MacDougall, and William J. Turkel: “We fabricate objects related to our own historical interests, and then we play with them, modify them, share them with other people, and use them to ground conversations about the past and our relationship to it.”[1] While the exchange, examination, and manipulation of objects–historical or not–is an important mode of critical inquiry, there are important distinctions to be raised when these objects belong to an unaccounted for original context or are situated in contexts where playfulness and sharing might not be a welcome mode of cultural inquiry. 

The source files for desktop fabrication, particularly desktop 3D printing, are often accessed through online social communities such as [instructables](http://www.instructables.com/), [YouMagine](https://www.youmagine.com/), [Autodesk1123](http://www.123dapp.com/Search/content/all), and the example I'll focus on here: [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/). All of these sites feature some form of social file sharing, where digitized or digitally designed objects can be uploaded as files, which can then be shared and discussed amongst in a community of like-minded "makers." Each of these websites--or digital file archives, to be more exact--facilitates the exchange and, to some extent, production of objects using a variety of desktop technologies. That is to say, once the user is in possession of the file hosted on the these sites, they can choose to either admire, fabricate, or discuss the object contained in that file, doing nothing with it. Alternatively, they can download the file and reproduce the object using a 3D printer or other desktop fabrication technology or bring it into a makerspace, hackerspace, or other spaces that facilitate fabrication. All of these venues and methodologies for accessing digitized objects represent communities of exchange, where objects--in digital form--are exchanged and processed or reprocessed. 







 


Something in here about Thingiverse and communities of exchange. Briefly

Taking this filament linking the completed object to the politics of its revival into account then, it seems reasonable to suggest that working with desktop fabrication technologies to remake objects for contemplation is fabricating more than merely objects for scrutiny or playful exchange. What the social dynamics and cultures springing up around desktop fabrication technologies seem to create new narratives embedded in the tactility of the objects they revive, reproduce, or oddly, erase even further—making stone into plastic.

In particular, how should we consider, integrate, or confront narratives called forward by the revival of objects that no longer exist in their original context?

We don't often think about how the act of fabrication--as it is understood in technological contexts of makerspaces and desktop fabrication--creates problematic narratives.

Fabrication, as it is understood in the emerging technological and digital contexts of makerspaces and desktop fabrication, is about storytelling. Remaking things, designing things, and sharing things creates discourses about those objects 

In particular, I'm interested in how remaking things that have disappeared encourages narratives about the object grounded not in the object itself, but in the ephemeral experience of it.

"We are detectives, piecing together forensic evidence .... looking for things our subjects took for granted or left unspoken .... Historical writing is thus an imaginative recreation of the past." (122)

"the proliferation of digital sources--both the born-digital and the digitized--has created an economy of abundance" (122)   

Reproducing a trinket-sized model of The World Trade Center as it looked prior to the 9/11 terrorist attacks suggests that the fabrication of such objects tell us much about the effect of the objecephemera. In other words, I'm interested in how remaking things that have disappeared encourages the emergence of narratives that surround the object as much as it revives the object itself. The object, reproduced as a "conversation piece" encourages conversation not only about how it was made, or the process of its fabrication (both digitally and actually) along with personal narratives that centre on emotional resonance.




Generally speaking, when I think about fabrication in the humanities, I think about reviving objects that no longer exist: 

"matter as a new medium for historical research" (T 122)

"the proliferation of digital sources--both the born-digital and the digitized--has created an economy of abundance" (122)   





An erased space is one that leaves a trace but no longer exists. The erased space is not empty (that is, not a space in the true sense), it holds the trace of something erased. By erased space, I mean something akin to The World Trade Center, which is at once the erased space of the Twin Towers and the emerging space of One World Trade Center (or, more commonly, "Freedom Tower"). The World Trade Center space holds traces of the Twin Towers--indeed the memorial itself--and provides an area for the Freedom Tower. The Twin Towers have been erased, but there lingers an aura of their existence; an existence that is reinforced both by the redemptive narratives associated with Freedom Tower and the renewed World Trade Center site and with the 9/11 Memorial to the victims of the September 2011 terrorist attacks. 

Erased spaces represent spaces where there is evidence of--or an aura of--things removed--marks of something having been--or even the invisible attempts to remove all traces associated with thought, feeling, history, or memory. At the same time, erased spaces also represent the potential of an expanse that is free, open, and unoccupied--ready and approved as a space for renewal and revision.


- a continuous area or expanse that is free, available, or unoccupied.
- rub out or remove (writing or marks).
- remove all traces of (a thought, feeling, or memory).
- ephemera - things that exist or are used or enjoyed for only a short time -- items of collectible memorabilia, typically written or printed ones, that were originally expected to have only short-term usefulness or popularity.

Erased space is a theoretical name for absence, but an absence that attempts to capture the idea that even in absencia, there lingers the ephemera of the object that occupied that space prior to its erasure. It tries to account for the lingering marks of what came before, and what suggests the potential for the new. 

3D printing and other emerging digital technologies, unlike the crafts of the past, lean toward creating ephemera. The rub is that they often make ephemera out of things that once had resonance--like the Twin Towers. 

How does the student of cultural history then account for the shift from something resonant and tangible into something ephemeral and trinket-based. The answer is to think not about the object itself, but the erased space it may have occupied and examine the triggers associated with its re-making or fabrication. Complexly, to look at the ephemera made by remaking. 

This is not a playful exercise. This effort tries to account for the lasting resonance of ephemera, separated from its disposable, or short life-cycle, ephemera often defines who we are, where we have been, how we see ourselves. These objects--trinkets--carry particular resonance to the individuals that own them, experience them, or associate them with someone or some experience. (QUOTES) 

 

Objects as erased spaces because they both occupy space and offer space. LIke a building, these objects present themselves in the space and take up space, but at the same time offer the potential for more space. 


The social exchange of these digitized objects does not account for the ephemera of the erased spaces those objects might have occupied. Sharing the digitized file removes the object further from its original context. The narratives around the object focus on the success of its making rather than its function as historical object. The object holds fascination not as a object for reverence or historical contemplation; instead, it becomes the subject of narratives around the process of its fabrication. 

That said, the erased space remains. The ephemera or experiential narratives associated with the object remain. These narratives are triggered by the object itself. While we cannot remake erased spaces, we can fabricate on top of them, imposing different narratives on top of the old ones. 

I'm particularly interested in how we reproduce such erased spaces, particularly the lingering shreds of memory associated with what's been erased, in the social milieu that often marks maker cultures or fabrication. 

Taking this filament linking the completed object to the politics of its revival into account then, it seems reasonable to suggest that working with desktop fabrication technologies to remake objects for contemplation is fabricating more than merely objects for scrutiny. What the social dynamics and cultures springing up around desktop fabrication technologies do is create new ephemeral experiences embedded in the tactility of the objects they revive, reproduce, or oddly, erase even further—making stone into plastic.

We need to account for how the object itself encourages narratives--and what narratives it encourages more particularly.

One gets a very clear sense of the issues raised by fabrication technologies such as 3D printers when the objects to be reproduced become uncomfortable. For instance, reproducing erased spaces or objects is pretty great when "there is an element of play to this kind of research. In fact, one of the main reasons that we do it is because it is fun."[^4] 


Largely determined outside the parameters of the 3D printer, scale and materiality are rendered moot by the tyranny of error brought on by the use of the hardware and software required to produce the object. Source files are corrupt, the software used to make those files sometimes dubious, and the printing machines themselves are prone to misalignment, failure, or technical misreadings. As the still nascent activity of desktop 3D printing—along with other forms of desktop fabrication such as laser cutters and millers for that matter—finds legs, the practices and principles that guide fabrication are born out of a community of hobbyists or transient professionals. As a result, there is little in the way of quality control beyond the community of practice, which does not yet fully account for the potential signification that errors in fabrication might yield.


With its flat colour, trailing spindles, lopsided planks, and buttered edges, the 3D printed Altar above shows the many layers of its fabrication that cannot be peeled back. The errors visible, the object becomes a bastardized fabrication of the original, forever rendered in plastic. The fabrication has not melted seamlessly, blending the layers into one another, creating the perception of smoothness, refinement, and completion. Instead, the hardware—and the process that governs its use—scans, renders, and finally fabricates erased spaces, representing a re-colonization rather than a renewed existence—one that is set off by the errors inherent in the object final state. The ugly fabricated Altar makes the cultural truths the object is trying to preserve subject to perversion, forcing us to ask: “What kind of reproduction is this? What are we fabricating: exploitation, destruction, displacement?”


Traditionally, such results are taken in a negative light. However, there is much to be gained from having the cultural truths the object carries with it into our world revealed so evidently. In short, the tyranny of error reveals another set of questions or avenues for interrogating the original object. The fabrication, like most lies, reveals more truth than we might otherwise give credence. We are forced into questions not only about the makers of the original object, but also our own motivations, our own shortcomings--technological, sociological, cultural, textual, pedagogical--in our approach to the original object; the trinket reveals much about its maker, owner, and the politics of its exchange. What the fabrication of erased spaces might show us is that these spaces are not artifacts in a tactile or material sense, but rather are symbolic of a set of emotional, cultural, and economic realities that need to be read, examined, and critiqued thoughtfully so that we are equipped to process the enlightenment they might provide about our cultural moment past and present. Fabrication then invites us to account for the “fixed” truths fabricated by the 3D printing machine.
